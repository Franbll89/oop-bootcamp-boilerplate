    <li>I want to park my car in a parking lot</li>
    <li>I want to retrieve my car from a parking lot</li>
    <li>I hired an assistant to park and retrieve cars</li>
    <li>I'm earning money!!!
    I decide to buy more pking lots!
    A parking lot assistant handles multiple parking lots, parking a car in the first parking lot with space
    </li>
    <li>My assistant is scratching the cars
    A parking lot assistant parks a car in a parking lot only if it is less than 80% full
