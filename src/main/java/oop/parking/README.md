    <li>I want to park my car in a parking lot</li>
    <li>I want to retrieve my car from a parking lot</li>
    <li>I hired an assistant to park and retrieve cars</li>
    <li>I'm earning money!!!
    I decide to buy more pking lots!
    A parking lot assistant handles multiple parking lots, parking a car in the first parking lot with space
    </li>
    <li>My assistant is scratching the cars
    A parking lot assistant parks a car in a parking lot only if it is less than 80% full
    </li>
    <li>I want to save resources
    I (owner) want to be notified when parking lot usage is less than 20% so that I can close down some parkings
    </li>
    <li>A parking lot assistant parks large cars in the parking lot with the least % of usage</li>
    <li>A parking lot assistant parks handicapped cars in the first parking lot that accepts handicapped cars</li>
